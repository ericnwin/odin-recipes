    <h3><u>Description</u></h3>
    <p>This Pan-Seared Steak has a garlic rosemary-infused butter that makes it taste steakhouse quality. You’ll be
        impressed at how easy it is to make the perfect steak – seared and caramelized on the outside, and so juicy
        inside.</p>
    <h4><u>Ingredients</u></h4>
    <div class="ingredients">
        <ul>
            <li>2 lbs of New York Strip Steak</li>
            <li> 1/2 Tbsp vegetable oil or any high heat cooking oil like canola or extra light olive oil </li>
            <li> 1 1/2 tsp sea salt </li>
            <li> 1 tsp black pepper freshly ground </li>
            <li> 2 Tbsp unsalted butter </li>

        </ul>

    <div class="steps">
        <h4><u>Preparation</u></h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Thoroughly pat steak dry with paper towels. Just before cooking, generously season with 1 1/2 tsp salt
                and 1 tsp black pepper
            </li>
            <li>Heat the cast iron pan until hot then add 1/2 Tbsp oil over medium-high heat, swirling to coat. Once the
                oil is very hot, add steaks to the skillet. Sear the steaks on the first side for 4 minutes until a
                brown crust has formed then flip and cook another 3-4 minutes. Using tongs, turn the steak on its sides
                to render the white fat and sear the edges (1-minute per edge).</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium and immediately add 2 Tbsp butter, quartered garlic cloves and rosemary to the
                pan. Spoon the butter sauce over the steak, tilting the pan to get butter on your spoon. Continue
                spooning the sauce over the steak for a minute or until the steak is about 5-10 degrees from your
                desired doneness (the temperature will continue to rise another 5-10 degrees while steaks rest).</li>
            <li>Transfer steak to a cutting board, loosely cover and rest 10 minutes before slicing into 1/2" strips to
                serve. Spoon extra butter sauce over sliced steak to serve.</li>
        </ol>
