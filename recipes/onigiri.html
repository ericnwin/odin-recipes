        <h4><u>Preparation</u></h4>
        <ol>
            <li>While rice is being soaked and drained (45 minutes), prepare the onigiri fillings.</li>
            <li>
                <b>Okaka filling:</b> Put katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes) in a bowl and add 2 Tbsp soy
                sauce.
                Mix to combine.
                Katsuobushi should be moistened but not drenched in soy sauce.
            </li>
            <li><b>Tuna mayo filling:</b> Put drained canned tuna in a bowl and add 2 Tbsp Japanese mayonnaise and ½
                Tbsp soy
                sauce. Mix to combine.</li>
            <li><b>Seasoned kombu filling:</b> Put the purchased seasoned kombu in a bowl for easy access later.</li>
            <li>Cut the nori sheets in thirds (⅓).</li>
            <li>First, wet both of your hands with water in order to prevent the rice from sticking to your hands.</li>
            <li>Then put some salt in your hands and rub to spread all around your palms. How much salt? I dip 3 finger
                tips in kosher salt shown in the picture below. If you are using table salt, use half amount as it’s
                saltier than kosher salt.</li>
            <li>Scoop out a handful of warm rice (about ⅓ cup) into one hand. Create a small well (indentation) in the
                center of the rice. Put one kind of filling (about 1-2 tsp) inside. Then mold the rice with your hands
                around the well to cover your filling completely.</li>
            <li>Press the rice around the filling to gently form the rice into a triangle. I use three fingers (thumb,
                index finger, middle finger) to make a triangle corner. Your hands should be just firm enough so the
                onigiri doesn’t fall apart. You don’t want to squeeze the rice too tight.</li>
            <li>Wrap the onigiri with nori seaweed.</li>
            <li>Place a little bit of each filling on top of onigiri so we know which kind it is. </li>
        </ol>
